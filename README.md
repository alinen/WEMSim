# WEMSim

# How to build

1. Download and build [Unreal Engine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine)
2. Clone this repository (in its own directory, not inside Unreal)
3. Open WEMSim.uproject. When prompted, point to the Unreal Engine you installed in step (1). This will generate solution files, initialize, and open the project.
